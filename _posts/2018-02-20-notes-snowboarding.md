<strong>Quite appropriate since I'm making a snowboarding game right now.</strong>

<ul>
	<li>First time gaming kids can't play snowboard kids.
Let that sink in. As mentioned in blog post 5. it's due to analog sticks.</li>
	<li>You are secured to your board in real snowboarding as well as in current videogames</li>
	<li>Tricks seemed to be an important aspect of some games but frankly they're not interactive</li>
	<li>Steep is really cool but maybe the snowboarding is too realistic to create deeper gameplay (but it was a combination of games ala blog post 4.)</li>
	<li>There isn't any game that breaks the rules of snowboarding</li>
</ul>
<strong>Actually in general it seems the snowboarding games with analog sticks:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Do not need analog sticks if the snowboarder leans gradually enough</li>
	<li>Tricks and pipe grinds are common mechanics that require aiming the board and nice button presses</li>
	<li>It's all about not having to press an accelerator button</li>
	<li>The most unrealistic thing was snowboard kids' mario kart style weapons... but we can do more to affect the core gameplay</li>
	<li>The unique part of core gameplay is the steering. Jumping exists in way too many games, so it doesn't count for uniqueness.</li>
</ul>
