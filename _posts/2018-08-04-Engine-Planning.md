Game engine dev log part 1: what am I doing?

First, there needs to be some motivation or else I'll start this project and never finish it.

<b>[Motivation]</b>

I need to know more about how game engines are made, and I might as well make one while learning.
(Create to get better at creating)

I want to make something reusuable (not code an entire game within a while loop)

I want to expand the scope of the engine if theres anything else I need to learn
If i want to learn how to utilise a CPU with many cores, I need the code to support it.
(The engine thus needs to be modular)

Of course, the skills I learn are more important than supplanting existing game engines.

<b>[Outcomes]</b>

Making these happen isn't a chore, but I have to make sure I don't forget them.

 - Having fun
 - Readable intuitive code and folders
 - Production code quality
 - Better intuition for making a game from start to finish
 - Better understanding of game engines
 - Better understanding of making games work in game engines
 
The last point will require me to actually make games using my own engine. Exciting.

You might think having fun is difficult, but the secret is just finding your own rewards.

If you do it means "you care about what you're working on".

Will my optimism run dry? Or will I become the next Iwata? No harm in trying!

Ahem, the code is at: https://github.com/iuyhcdfs/amaneshi
