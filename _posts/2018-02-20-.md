both games are targeted to be easy to play

to some extent

we have issues with depth of the mechanics

yoshi had tongue and egg mechanics typically

how does it keep stuff fresh

how many gimmicks basically

kirby powerups

also just getting to the end

powerups can have depth though

yoshis story doesnt feel as rich as island

maybe cause of level amount and whats in it

yoshis story is kinda like, haphazard stuff, you go around doing things

and youre finished once you do enough stuff

its very strange.Â  unorthodox. do people like this or not i dunno

i think it's fresh but if you have expectations you wont enjoy it as much

&nbsp;

whats that about kirby

we didnt even have powerups in dream land

just fight enemies and get through stages

surprisingly simple in that regard

the amazing mirror had alot of need this here and that

more exploring and an interconnected world
