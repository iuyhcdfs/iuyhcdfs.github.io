Nintendo Labo is a low-tech housing for the high-tech joycons.
Fun to play, but whether or not others enjoy building them like I have is unclear.

The Experience:
 - You fold together cardboard, and nicely arranged tabs and pieces combine to form the "toycon" controllers.
 - Tabs that seemed irreversible can actually still be popped open and closed many times. Corrugated cardboard is quite good!
 - You then play games using these controllers.
 - There is motion sensing tech in all joycons, and infrared sensors to detect other objects.
 - The discover section actually teaches you everything in an entertaining way if you're not an engineer. You could definetly nurture some kids with this.

Thoughts:
 - Motorcycle is not suitable for large people with large hands
 - Most experiences are quite complete. You definetly feel that the cardboard has become a controller
 - Playtesting: most players find a reasonable experience in each game. 
 - Playtesting: for fishing, most players don't spot animation/sound queues immediately (if you do, fishing becomes very simple)
 - Playtesting: I didn't expect 1v1 RC cars to be HOURS of fun.
 - Playtesting: leaning to turn in the robot had to be done, but is imperfect, expectation-wise
 - Playtesting: people love the robot, but don't have the endurance to jump back in. (or perhaps the appeal is limited)
 
 - The main purchase factor is willingness and time to build. Obviously this gears it towards kids.
 - The variety kit felt like good value for money. 
 - The robot kit only provides itself, which is hard to recommend, but was new and interesting.
 
 - There is still an air of novelty around the toycons... maybe there is some way to make them more of a "must-buy"
 - You could have toy-con compatible features in other games apart from garage creations
 
On Advertising:
 - No advertisements demonstrate longevity/repairing (open close tabs, sticking on reinforcing cardboard from anywhere).
 It was a liberating feeling when I taped a stolen flap from a tissue box onto a bent RC car's leg to make it work again. 
 - The cool tactile feedback (all rubber band components) could have been demonstrated more, which did happen in the Bill Nye video.
