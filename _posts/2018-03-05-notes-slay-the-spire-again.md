played more. last set of notes for Slay the Spire

<ul>
	<li>When you're playing around with different cards and picking them up out of curiosity that is some kind of entertainment</li>
	<li>Discovering that picking up a very very small set of cards only is very satisfying because you can finally beat the last fight</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>As far as roguelike retry incentives go, being able to select 1 of 4 starting variations is important. But more important is that you must at least <em>reach</em> the first act's boss to gain the bonus. If you're playing for endgame victory and not just to try out cards, you might end up rejecting so many cards you cant clear the first act. But you still refresh the new game bonus at least.
<em>Basically it's tweaked to accommodate playstyles (of varying potentials of success)</em></li>
	<li>Bosses at the end of the 3 acts are randomised. Some of them outright kill certain builds. This is... just the nature of roguelikes. There however is at least 1 build for each class that when completed, should defeat any boss (given enough health).</li>
	<li>The coolest decks are of course, the most powerful. Being able to have an infinite combo (certain cards or relics do allow this) or huge damage scaling (strength+heavy strike, high defense + poison stacking) is much more satisfying.</li>
	<li><em>Winning in Roguelikes is special from the contrast of countless failures.</em> This only works in games obviously where you're encouraged to accept a loss and play again.</li>
	<li><em>Deck building games build satisfaction from experimentation and victory. </em>Intrigue over a new run, or trying to refine an already attempted strategy draws you in.</li>
	<li>The above two obviously hint they'd go together.</li>
	<li>Daily challenges break the careful balance of the game for a harder difficulty. This is good for people who are strongly experienced with the genres. But DAMN they're hard. I'm not strongly experienced at this genre</li>
	<li>fast mode could go faster.</li>
	<li>the relics have good variety... for now. some boss relics actually can sabotage the player but fortunately, they're usually only choosable (and thus skippable) at the end of an act's boss.</li>
	<li>the end of the third act is interesting. I dont know where they're going with this but its a nice way to hint at more content</li>
	<li>Unfortunately, there will always be some cards that are not worth getting to contrast with cards worth getting.</li>
	<li>Some mystery area events are actually really really good. And yet they might not make the difference in a run depending on the final boss.
Anyway this is still fair because <em>the final boss of each act is actually revealed by the artwork on the map. </em>This does require some player knowledge however.
Whether one act is enough to prepare for a deck-countering boss is... suffice to say up to chance.</li>
	<li>The game feels fair when it often times won't be.</li>
	<li>I've decided to stop at 17 hours for now. Steam friends seem to have all played... much much more.
This game isn't like slot machines (you don't put in money each time to play, personally those games don't appeal to me)
And yet, the amount of time you put into this game, even into a run that can't make it to the final boss (but might with lower odds) is compelling.Still the amount of time concerns me. I still haven't decided whether this is about quality or tapping into addiction, or both.

I said last time you feel like you're in control of this game. Do gambling addicts feel in control during the moment they pay to play another round? Tough stuff to think about.

Even if I hit 100 hours, my playtime is still going to be eclipsed by my friends.</li>
