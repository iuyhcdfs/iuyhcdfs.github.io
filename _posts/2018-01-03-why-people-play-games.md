	<li>you are stuck playing a game you invested time into</li>
	<li>a game has an alluring business model</li>
	<li>you enjoy finding and abusing the best mechanics in a constantly patched game</li>

	<li>you just wanted some cheap challenge that you can vs your friends in and move onto the next</li>
