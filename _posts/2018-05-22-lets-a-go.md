Now documenting things on my own site, instead of where I <a href="https://iuondesign.wordpress.com/">previously blogged on iuondesign.wordpress.com.</a> I make game notes and I explain anything cool that I've learnt.

Is it okay to share notes and thoughts? Yes. It's interesting to see other peoples thoughts, and if you're really set on doing something creative, you'll do it your way. 

Hopefully as I become more experienced the entertainment value increases.
