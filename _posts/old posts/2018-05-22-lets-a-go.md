I previously blogged <i>game notes and thoughts</i> on iuondesign.wordpress.com. Don't worry, I've already imported my old blog onto this website. All posts older than this are from iuondesign!

Is it okay to share notes and thoughts? Yes. It's interesting to see other peoples thoughts, and if you're really set on doing something creative, you'll do it your way. 

Hopefully as I become more experienced the entertainment value increases.
