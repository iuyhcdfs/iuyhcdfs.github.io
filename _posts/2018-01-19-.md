I merely drew this for no reason.

<p style="text-align:center;">Looking at how games (could) have balanced gameplay and story

<p style="text-align:center;">Stories &gt; Sacrifice &gt; Dissonance &gt; Harmony &gt; Closing</p>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>"stories": why, or <em>how</em> to care</strong></h2>
I trust you. You already have an intuition for what a story does in a game, and how it makes you feel. Lets get abstract instead. Here's some ways of describing what a story is.
<ul>
	<li>Its a sequence of events in some order, and is typically coherent.</li>
	<li>It follows characters or entities that might interact with each other.</li>
	<li>A good story makes the player care about it.</li>
</ul>
You may notice that the descriptive sentences I just cherry-picked can also be used to describe gameplay. Events, interactions and player engagement are common products of either gameplay or story. Games can be a mashup of art, sound, story and interaction after all.

<strong>So is it necessary? </strong>Well, it's necessary if you want it to be.<em> </em>You're silly if you want to weave lore into <em>Wii Sports, </em>but even Mario is usually informed to rescue Peach.

Otherwise remember, the story takes residence in the player's mind. If you give them too many <strong>"Things"</strong> (visual/audio/story/gameplay) to think about at the same time, an overwhelmed brain will simply forget about <strong>Things</strong> to avoid being overwhelmed.

Some games will have to make a choice:
<ul>
	<li>"I have to sacrifice story for gameplay!"</li>
	<li>"I have to sacrifice gameplay for story!"</li>
	<li>"I can make both work together!"</li>
</ul>
We'll have some example games that deal with this, but if you haven't played them, you're sure to find a game that follows the ideas coming up.

So with that said, lets look into the first two choices.
<h2><strong>"sacrifice": if you're not massively scaled</strong></h2>
In society, the fuel we burn is money and time. Assuming the player is only hooked for a few hours total, you can only give them a small collection of thrills. <em>And if you aren't the largest, well funded team, you have to sacrifice something.</em>

In that case, you might want to focus on perfecting the gameplay or the narrative. It's the difference between Uncharted and The Last of Us. In a more extreme case, it's the difference between Tetris and a Telltale Games series.

&nbsp;

If you see the flow of a game suffer because story dialogue needed to unfold, or if it costs too much resources to let environments and NPCs let the story tell itself, <strong>maybe yes, sacrifice story for gameplay.</strong> Make the story simpler and more intuitive or obvious.

If you wish to have multiple choices and consequences for dialogue and actions on a story, <strong>you can't afford to sacrifice the story</strong><strong>. </strong>There is no point chaining your game to the story if it wasn't worth telling in the first place.

This has been happening for generations.

But now, what happens when we refuse to compromise on gameplay and story?
<h2><strong>"dissonance": when design is too greedy</strong></h2>
First, <em>lets look at when it goes wrong.</em>

<strong>1. Player expectations become haphazard</strong>

<strong>2. Too much branching complexity</strong>

<strong>3. You can't end the story</strong>

<b>Minor gripe with branches: players might not experience everything in a single play through and they might not play a second time.</b>

<strong>4. Players prefer to watch a long-play/lets-play of your game.</strong>

Hope is not lost however, some games have done it right. Here comes the fun part of this blog post.
<h2><strong>"harmony": when design is very smart</strong></h2>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>"closing"</strong></h2>
One unique aspects of videogames is that, you choose what happens.

You can choose what you experience.

You can also choose to ignore the story if you rather focus on the gameplay.

You could love the music and have never even touched the game.

But if you're the creator, you probably want people buying and playing your games. Videos of a player finishing your game from a lets-play or long-play could promote your game, but it could also make buying it <em>unnecessary.</em>

There's one last scary thing to consider.

If you write a really, really good story, people are going to remember your game for the story. In fact a story that is so good will make the gameplay relatively less memorable (but it still needs to be good or else the game fails).

Can you keep writing terrific stories? If you're in a team, do you want your IP to live and die by this? Unless you're all in on story telling, be careful!

Have fun out there won't you?

<strong>[2. story's got a game to tell]</strong>

STORY: characters plotlines and stuff.
some games use it alot, like etc
some games dont like etc. instead used to point out a new goal
the feeling it generates in a player
can you identify wit hthe characters or admire or hate them

PAYOFF: of a rich story of course
invested in characters and outcomes
resolution and twists
can intertwine with gameplay, may be nice
may just be an interesting story in it's own right

METAL GEAR SOLID 2

SABOTAGE: conflict of gameplay and story
particularly any branching story and it's ending, having to program etc
lets look at choose your own adventure books too

TRADEOFF: balancing the two
ludonarrative goals
just having them be disjoint at times
look at say professor layton MOST puzzles come out of banter
then there could be story puzzles too

CLOSING: diy

got a spectrum of doing story/gameplay things

the extreme gameplay: nintendo miyamoto/yokoi style
any sprites or quick lore is to make gameplay/player goals more intuitive to pick up

the extreme story: telltale style
the story happens to be... almost everything

Some other examples

mass effect/life is strange/majoras mask

but mass effect life is strange endings oh dear

professor layton VS phoenix wright

ml superstar saga/paper mario ttyd

parallel lines: command and conquer's cutscenes

¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬need ot research hollow knight

things about preventing a story from ruining a game

has this happened probably

when do you need to create more game for the sake of story

thats an issue

how to make a story emerge from a game

&nbsp;

constraints in design can come from it basically
