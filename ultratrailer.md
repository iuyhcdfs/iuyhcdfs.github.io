ultra trailer lyrics

[THIS SUMMER]
[THE WORLDS GREATEST]
[REALITY]
[COMING SOON]

da-dada-dadada etc

oooh aaaaAAAHHH call it quits, 'cause we're done now 
always like this, you're so down 
couldn't get, anything done
ahh ahh ahh ahh 

twisted feelings all around
common sense cannot be found
solid ground falling down

maybe it
could just be a monster
shadow or penumbra
or just your reflection caught in a mirror, its you!

whats the cause of my bad luck 
true feelings from inside
ripped out into the light
ban! ban! ban!

fall down!
messed it all up (ah ha)
no turning back on this, what a weirdo!
so what, they're always causin' trouble though!

cant say its something your parents should see
a life that is shameful to such a degree..

is the sky a space thats full of unending potential?
does it just make me existential?

do something stupid
is there nothing to it
karma's a bitch and its
COMING SOON

from here, whats in store for you is something nobody can see
your luck might turn, you might just burn, hopes and dreams and your concerns
waiting for you
especially waiting for you

WAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

imagine-if all-of-life was-kickstarted
from-something thats-as half-hearted
as-scribbles that you-wrote when you're ten

if we ever met again i'd like to ask you then
i might even tell you the truth

its something i regret
and its like we never met
you're trapped inside the past in my head
if i couldn't tell apart
the beating of my heart
life is easier just thumping along
reality you cannot rewind
moving on make the most of your time

waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

YEAH! ONE MORE TIME

oh i see, we're all just dumb
just making sure ok. that looks so cool!
theres no way that would take me down!

too fast to see, an era of anarchy
its all coming soon to a theater near you

your ideals fill the void and bury the sky
intrusive thoughts can say goodbye

the two of us laughed 
then one of us cried
then none of of us left so ONE MORE TIME!
if a fantasy fails to last forever then its not for me!
the mysteries, the good and bad, shame and passion, all of that
don't wait, i'll catch up and meet you now

daddaddaddaddaaddaddadaddaddaddaaddadda
THIS IS THE ULTRA TRAILER!
THE MOVIE HASN'T STARTED YET!
GO BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS
BEYOND THE SEAS AND SKIES AND
YOULL TELL ME WHAT YOUR HEART SAYS INSTEAD!

daaddadalalala
daddaddaddaddaaddaddadaddaddaddaaddadda
THIS IS THE ULTRA TRAILER!
EXCEED, IMAGIN-ATION!

FEELINGS CATCHING FIRE, BEYOND WHAT WORDS INSPIRE
CAN SET MY HEART ABLAZE ONE MORE TIME

uuuUUUUUUOOOOOAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

[There's a hope, a dream, an ideal.]
[So long as i continue to persue it]
[I will never die!]

[yeah, but the world is just about to end!?]
