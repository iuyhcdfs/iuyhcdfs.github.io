Nintendo Labo is a low-tech housing for the high-tech joycons.
I've played it. I made others play it. Here's some raw notes.

I didn't get an opportunity to observe how different people <i>built the toycons.</i> 
But I did see them play with the final controllers. 

The Experience:
 - You fold together cardboard, and nicely arranged tabs and pieces combine to form the "toycon" controllers.
 - Tabs that seemed irreversible can actually still be popped open and closed many times. Corrugated cardboard is quite good!
 - You then play games using these controllers.
 - There is motion sensing tech in all joycons, and infrared sensors to detect other objects.
 - The discover section actually teaches you everything in an entertaining way if you're not an engineer. You could definetly nurture some kids with this.

Thoughts:
 - Most experiences are quite complete. You definetly feel that the cardboard has become a controller
 - Incomplete toycons: Motorcycle doesn't suit large hands, turning in the Robot kit was a necessary compromise.

Playtesting:
 - Most players find a reasonable experience in each game. 
 - For fishing, most players don't spot animation/sound queues immediately (if you do, fishing becomes very simple). Are they immersed?
 - I didn't expect 1v1 RC cars to be HOURS of fun.
 - People love the robot, but don't have the endurance to jump back in. (or perhaps the appeal is limited. how can I tell?)
 
Afterthoughts:
 - The main purchase factor is willingness and time to build. Obviously this gears it towards kids.
 - The variety kit felt like good value for money. 
 - The robot kit only provides itself, which is hard to recommend, but was new and interesting.
 
 - There is still an air of novelty around the toycons... you'd need multiple uses for each toycon, i.e. you'd want to see them more as controllers than toys.
 - Example: the piano could have controlled a pinball game, and that would have provided more replay value. (Not everyone will use the toycon garage)
 
Hmmmmm:
 - No advertisements demonstrate longevity/repairing (open close tabs, sticking on reinforcing cardboard from anywhere).
 It was a liberating feeling when I taped a stolen flap from a tissue box onto a bent RC car's leg to make it work again. 
 - Some of the cool toycon feedback (all rubber band components) could have been demonstrated more. We never saw the motorcycle handle snap back when released in the initial reveal trailer.
