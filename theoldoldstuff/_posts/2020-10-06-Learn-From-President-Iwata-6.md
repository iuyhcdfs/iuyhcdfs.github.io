    Learn From the President! Part 6:
    Things often self-imposed.
    社長に学ぶ！
    『6』常に自分課していたこと。

> So your timeline at HAL Laboratory was first part-time, being put in charge of development, and then becoming the development director?

Yeah.
I was seen as the one responsible for development,
so somehow my business card had section chief printed on it. At the same time I started acting as the development director too.

> Well thats how the young "Iwata-kun" was at the start.
> 
> Even then, did word of "That so-called Iwata" reach the higher-ups at Nintendo?

Well back then, it was quite uncommon to find anyone who could touchtype (type without looking at the keyboard).

So when I'd head over to Nintendo to finish up a program, people would say 
"Thats an amazing typing speed" as I pounded away on the keyboard. It felt like I was putting on a show.

Various people would take turns stopping by my room, and everyone would walk off saying "Its true! Thats really fast!". It really was an early era (laughter).

> It must have looked like a magician performing a trick. You were the master of the keyboard so the speak.

I continued to make software, but the kind of games were "Already designed, but nobody was able to develop it so it's in trouble".
By making them I got some amount of recognition in terms of my technological ability.

> So around then you were fully committed to walking the path of an engineer.

Yes, as you say.

> Maybe you weren't the coach of the team, but you're out on the field, with nothing to do but enjoy each new match.

Absolutely.

> Before I met Iwata-san, based on rumors I got the impression you were trying
> to build "A computer that builds games" or something like that.
>
> As an engineer, do you see us heading to some other high-concept future?

When making anything, the struggles faced everyday can be split into two types.
The first type of hardship makes you think "Well, this is something only a human can take care of", second is "You're drenched in sweat everyday but is it really right to continue pushing on like this? It'd be nice if a machine could do it though".

Thats why when a task is more suited to a machine, I think about how to automate it in an early stage.

I used to lose interest in simple work really quickly. I just wanted to take it easy focusing on work that interested me. If you're doing the same uncomplicated job day in, day out, inevitably you'd find it disagreeable.

> Iwata-san, you also don't want to force that on other people either correct?

Oh I find that extremely disagreeable.
