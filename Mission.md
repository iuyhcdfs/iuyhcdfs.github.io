やる気の話

So, what's your favourite game? Mine is the one where *you can reset time in order to stop a moon from falling in three days*.

Experimentation, and trying new ideas over and over until you have a result that helps other people. That game itself is the resultant mix of risk-taking and maybe overwork-induced nightmares from a 1 year development cycle.

To me, its a beautiful game. I want other people to get inspired by games like I have. All it takes is understanding what other people are thinking without time travel, the gumption to tell a computer what to do, experimentation, and trying new ideas over and over until you have a game that helps other people. 

### Currently I can wear the Programmer, Designer, and Planner *masks*. 

Even if I end up specializing, trying out various roles is trying out various points of view: thats good for communication!

This is a demo of all styled elements in Jekyll Now. 

[View the markdown used to create this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barryclark/www.jekyllnow.com/gh-pages/_posts/2014-6-19-Markdown-Style-Guide.md).

This is a paragraph, it's surrounded by whitespace. Next up are some headers, they're heavily influenced by GitHub's markdown style.

## Header 2 (H1 is reserved for post titles)##

### Header 3

#### Header 4
 
A link to [Jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/). A big ass literal link <http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/>
  
An image, located within /images

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-logo.png "an image title")

* A bulletted list
- alternative syntax 1
+ alternative syntax 2
  - an indented list item

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles: 

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()` 
 
> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote 
 
Syntax highlighting can be used by wrapping your code in a liquid tag like so:

{{ "{% highlight javascript " }}%}  
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}  

creates...

{% highlight javascript %}
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{% endhighlight %}
 
Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  
 
Finally, horizontal lines
