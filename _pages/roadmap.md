私は岩田氏に恩恵を負う

the goal is to be as amazing as satoru iwata

its okay to start small. its the only way you can start at all.

<b>make games.</b>

if you're to surpass the influence he made you'll need allies.

communication of course is key

and the secret to communication is <b>creating context</b>

the context is an idea, a way of thinking, an entire world. <b>different people live in different worlds</b> and if you can master this you can convince anyone

you'll need to handle larger things. be able to understand money and business

"enemies" are just another kind of technical problem to solve. you have to be better at negotiating, you need logic and leverage, and you'll need to find a way to turn "enemies" into "friends"

people who want you to win and who want you to lose

<b>just make sure if you win, they win. and vice versa.</b>

like all technical problems you should only deal with them when the time is right

things go out of control and you might wonder if what you are doing is related to games

but you have to just get back on track and keep going

flowing into whatever you set out to do

thats exactly what he did at least, 

<b>courage to disregard the consequences in new territory can come from anywhere</b>

<b>wherever you go make sure you take your heart with you</b>

<b>speed, correctness, innovation, health, figure out how to have an overwhelming amount of everything</b>
