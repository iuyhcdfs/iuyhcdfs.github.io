Trying to make articles is interesting and fun. But also time consuming.

Time consuming enough that some strong design thoughts pass by my head and miss this blog. That's no good.

When making a blog post I think it's important to have your voice speaking, but to avoid rambling. After doing the earlier posts, I'm starting to feel how you pick a subject narrow enough to avoid writing an entire thesis.

Getting the point across is super important.

Also I come up with ideas but they sometimes can be tangential. But sharing ideas is great. If somebody finds an idea and makes a great game with it, that's fantastic. We come up with more ideas than we can ever build.

I just want to see better games. maybe I have to do it myself?
