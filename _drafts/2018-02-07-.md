<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>There's no Mario Maker for 3D games, but that didnt stop Skelux.
</strong>The Super Mario 64 mod, Star Road. Different levels, same Mario

<p style="text-align:center;">The Mod &gt; Mechanics &gt; Camera &gt; Style &gt; Excitement &gt; One Problem &gt; Closing</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Just like the mod, it's assumed you're familiar with Super Mario 64.
Otherwise I hope the pictures help.

<h2><strong>the mod</strong></h2>
I still have a cartridge of Super Mario 64 with 120 stars. But if I started a new game, I already know all the levels, and all the jumps.

Instead I had a playthrough of Skelux's mod <a href="http://mario64hacks.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Mario_Star_Road" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Super Mario 64 Star Road" [link to wiki]</a>.

I played up to the last boss fight while finding stars preferably from the levels <strong>that I felt like playing.</strong> I ended up with 82/130 stars, since beating Bowser grants a star, and the road to Bowser had a bonus star <strong>which looked fun to get to</strong>.

I call that a casual playthrough. But it means I can look at my stars collected and remember which levels I liked the most.

The game engine is old but workable, although there are certain moments I would desperately wish for camera controls from the Gamecube era. That will change this year when Skelux releases a more refined edition by modding the Nintendo DS SM64 remake, which has a very different engine (and camera thankfully).

Overall, I'd say the mod has really great things that the original game didn't even have the <strong><em>intention</em></strong> of doing.

Lets talk about that.
<h2><strong>mechanics</strong></h2>
Arguably the coolest part of the mod is how it starts to push Mario to his limits.

These were the most memorable features in my casual playthrough.

1: The pole vault (handstand on a pole, then jump) actually is required to reach places.

2: Sticky slopes are used in cool ways. In SM64 they were merely introduced in the last level.

3: Some good precise jumping parts enforced by using more instant-death quicksand

4: More sections requiring triple jumps

5: More sections requiring wall kicks

6: Windows to break with jump attacks

7: Using momentum from a steep slide to jump long distances

<h2>engine limits: camera woes</h2>
The Super Mario 64 engine's camera can bump into things and rotates a fixed amount when you press C-left or C-right.

You can also switch from the default "Lakitu Cam" to "Mario Cam" which:
<ul>
	<li>zooms the camera in (but you can press C-down to zoom out again)</li>
	<li>tries to face Mario's <strong>back</strong>, and <b>realign itself</b> if it isn't</li>
</ul>
For some sequences, you seemingly would prefer a Tomb Raider style camera. "Mario Cam" however takes time to rotate when realigning.

There's two notable areas when you climb platforms inside a tower and a tree. These small sections were unappealing simply because of how much I had to <strong>fight the camera just so I could see what I needed to do.</strong>
<h2>level design: hiding in plain sight</h2>
Camera issues aside, there are many areas that are open enough to provide new interesting challenges that the camera can't spoil. These areas are actually very enticing!

As I'm typing it occurs to me that strangely I've never had time to play Mario Maker.

But anyway, I think the fundamental appeal in a Super Mario game was letting the player understand the challenge and letting them test their ability.

There can be moments that surprise the player, but given the appeal of a surprise is that it's unexpected, you can't rely on this throughout the entire game's design.

The more exciting moments that come to mind was...

<h2>save states: on player comfort</h2>
I'll keep this short. The game is much more enjoyable when using save states sparingly.

The only time I say this is when certain challenges are trial and error: When <strong>combining the jumping challenges with a camera that sometimes refuses to rotate,</strong> you might have to fail a jump and die just to figure out a platform's distance.

Then having to get all the way back to where I messed up is rather easy. But having to redo something I've done isn't as fun. And if you have to keep redoing it, it gets boring. Part of the flow of a game includes reaching something new.

Is Star Road without save states a masochistic game? A little. But maybe I'm getting old enough to worry about how I spend time or I'm simply wrong.
<h2>closing</h2>
Again, it's a great mod, go try it.

Last word on save states: If it makes the game 10 times better, its fine to use them.

Also, since this is a mod of a 64 game, you can't avoid playing it on an emulator. That way you can't feel guilty that other players might not have the opportunity to use save states, like you would with the original game running on a 64.

If save states in fact break a game and make it MUCH easier then I'd say you're just spoiling the game. For example if you had a random chance event that you can easily re-roll but if you didn't have save states you'd have to accept the first result you have, the intended design was to have the first random effect.

You might decide using save states at all is cheating. I've said enough, you play the games you want to.

Given this philosophical tirade on using save states it's rather appropriate to just say:
Have fun out there won't you?
