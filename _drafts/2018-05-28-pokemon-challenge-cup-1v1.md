Lets talk about how some form of a game is appealing (and who it appeals to).
This time its <s>Degenerate cockfighting</s> Pokemon showdown's challenge cup 1v1 mode!

First, I have to ask: Do you know what pokemon battles are like?

<b>[I don't know what pokemon battles are like]</b>
 - Pokemon come in many different species and types.
 - You combine up to 6 of them in a team, and send them out 1 or 2 at once in single or double battles.
 - You fight another player's team of pokemon.
 - Each pokemon has 4 "moves". Moves either attack to damage the opponent's pokemon, buff or debuff pokemon, or to inflict statuses.
 - This is turn based. each turn you and your opponent select a move, and they'll happen.
 - Each turn, the fastest pokemon makes their move occur first (some moves break or change this rule!)
 - Pokemon take damage depending on type affinity, the attacker's offensive stats, the defender's defensive stats, and other conditions.
 - Attacks have a small chance to land "Critical Hits", dealing bonus damage (and ignoring defensive buffs) for free.
 - Pokemon that lose all their health faint and can't be used in battle anymore.
 - During your turn, instead of using a pokemon's moves you could switch them out with another pokemon.
 - When switching, the opponent might still attack. This attack will then hit the pokemon you switched into battle.
 - You can switch pokemon to provide a more favourable matchup. If you have trouble with a fire type pokemon but you have a water type in your party, why not?
 - Defeat, well, faint all your opponents pokemon to win the battle.
 - You cannot steal your opponent's pokemon by throwing pokeballs at their pokemon.
 
Balancing a team out with different types and stats means that if one pokemon runs into trouble, you can switch into a better pokemon to handle the job.
Some teams might involve brute force, attacking when you have an advantage. Other teams might try to power up a single, unstoppable pokemon. Theres many strategies.

You have to spend time to learn each strategy, and get used to the opponents that use each. You have to gain the knowledge to make predictions based of it.
The game mode I am about to describe throws everything I just said out the window.

Challenge Cup 1v1 gives you 6 randomly generated pokemon. You first start by choosing one.

You also see the opponent's 6 pokemon, but you don't know their moves or stats, just their species.

Both you and your opponent pick a single pokemon to fight with.
