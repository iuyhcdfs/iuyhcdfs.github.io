Remembering what it's like to be a beginner/intermediate/almost expert player.

Before Beginner: 5 Years Old.

There was a tetris clone on pc called "bricklayer".
I didn't know about clearing lines, but the sound effect for dropping pieces and getting a game over was funny.
I'd mash the spacebar until I got a quick game over, and decided I won the "race".

My family was unsuccessful at getting me to play the game properly.

Beginner: 8 Years Old.

At some point I played Tetris DX on a Gameboy Color.

Intermediate: 14-18

Better Intermediate: 

Almost Expert: 

Conclusion:
