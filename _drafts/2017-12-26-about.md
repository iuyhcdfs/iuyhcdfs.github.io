<h3><strong>The blog is about game design:</strong></h3>
Be it good and bad parts of games, aspects of design I notice, and ideas that emerge from these thoughts.
<h3><strong>The blog has two goals:</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Have fun talking about intriguing aspects of design in games</li>
	<li>Improve my ability to express any important ideas, without wasting time</li>
</ol>
To improve my skills as a coder, I'll keep programming. But I love design so much.

It doesn't hurt to put ideas out there. I can look back and laugh if it's bad.
<h3><strong>Who is iuyhcdfs:</strong></h3>
David Sicong Zhou, Australian

A computer science degree at UNSW, Sydney.

I draw any of the blog post opening images in MS Paint for no particular reason

Has traveled quite a lot.
<h3><strong>Why are you using wordpress.com instead of .org or whatever?</strong></h3>
It works, and immediately. This maximizes the time I spend making things.
